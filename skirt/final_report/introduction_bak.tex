\section{Introduction}
This report document is about a simulation of a piece of cloth interacting with rigid bodies. With rigid bodies and cloth, the rigid bodies affect the cloth but not vice versa. In our simulation, the cloth must interact with its environment i.e. self-collision, cloth-character collision and cloth-objects collision must be regarded. Also, force will be considered, at least gravity. We use mass spring systems for simulating cloth to get it to look right physical properties of cloth which can folds, wrinkles and stretches to conform to its colliders. The appearance of the cloth comes primarily from response to these conditions, and we use computer graphics to render them. The simulation shows the cloth falling down and covering an object of sphere shape.
