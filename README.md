# ez-dc-ga

This is a small project during a pro-semonar. It models a piece of cloth in OpenGL. The main goal is to simulate physical phenomena like gravity, friction, object collission and so on.

# Build the code:
compile with following options:
-std=c++11 or -std=c++0x (use the C++ 11 dialect)
-LGL (add GL directory to the library path)
-lGL (the OpenGL library)
-lglut (the GL utility Toolkit - make sure 'freeglut' is installed, some extensions not present in the GLUT API are used)

# License
... to be decided soon.
